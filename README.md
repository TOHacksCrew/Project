# The Tree Huggers Reforestation Project!


Built for TOHacks 2022!

## Project Description
This is a website which allows anyone from anywhere and at anytime contribute to the planet. By the simple click of a button, one can easily plant a tree. Many people want to help our planet, but do not know how or do not have the time. However, thanks to this app, it only takes 5 seconds to help the planet. 

## How it does it
After taking the form data, the PHP checks if your email has already been entered to prevent duplicate entries. Upon this check, a POST request is made to the [Reforestation as a Service API](https://docs.digitalhumani.com/) to plant one tree in your name where it is needed most.

## What We Learned

    - Git and Github (version control),
